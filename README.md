Program: DropZone 1.0 
by: Team One Connection ( Caleb An, Ryan O'Connor, Ajay Kannan, Pibo Rock ) 

Program Requirements:
gtk+3.0 and chipmunk-6.1.3

Description: DropZone is the paradigm shift of PDS (polygon dropping strategy) genre of video games. You play as an alien Zorblaxian invader crushing the last remnants of the human resistance; to this end, you receive an experimental new plasma weapon that creates objects of variable shape, color, and mass. You use this weapon to drop shapes on the pitiful humans, who now reside in green boxes and cower beneath elaborate defenses. For each settlement, you have enough plasma for 3 objects before your reserve is depleted and you are marked a failure by the Zorblaxian high command. You may be joined in the effort by other players, with whom you can discuss strategy by utilizing the chat box. Note that ammo will be shared! Happy hunting. 

Compilation: The game is compiled by adding the chipmunk.a file to the FINAL folder and running the included Makefile.
